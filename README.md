# STISIM Impaired Driving Task Scripts and Data Cleaning

To use the R script, create the following folder:

drive_analyzer (which contains the folders)
analysis_summary
block_info (place the two .csv files block_order and column_names here)
data_to_analyze (this is where you drop your .csv files from STISIM - DO NOT PLACE PLB FILES HERE). 

The Driving Data Cleaner should read through these folders. More information can be found in the Driving Data Cleaning SOP.
